First a fading background
have a box full of unused body parts
have a pole and nuse static on page
have shadow boxes for letters 
have a button to reset game
have an alphabet class that has a grey out after select feature
Logic -
    happy path:
    once the letter is selected populate the corresponding 
    box with the selection.
        on win populate a modle with a free car pic.
    sad path:
    if an letter is selected without a place in the word then move first part to the hanging man.
        on lose populate a modle with a dead man face.

Bonus feature:
    have a cheat button that puts the word up for .5 seconds

    phone a friend feature that randomly takes away 3 letters

    Use an API to get random words
    Select a category for the word on game open.
